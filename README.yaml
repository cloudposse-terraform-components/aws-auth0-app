description: |-
  Auth0 Application component. [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/) is a third-party service that provides authentication and
  authorization as a service. It is typically used to to authenticate users.

  An Auth0 application is a client that can request authentication and authorization from an Auth0 server. Auth0
  applications can be of different types, such as regular web applications, single-page applications, machine-to-machine
  applications, and others. Each application has a set of allowed origins, allowed callback URLs, and allowed web origins.
usage: |-
  Before deploying this component, you need to deploy the `auth0/tenant` component. This components with authenticate with
  the [Auth0 Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/auth0/auth0/latest/) using the Auth0 tenant's
  client ID and client secret configured with the `auth0/tenant` component.

  **Stack Level**: Global

  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  >
  > Be sure that the context ID does not overlap with the context ID of other Auth0 components, such as `auth0/tenant`. We
  > use this ID to generate the SSM parameter names.

  ```yaml
  # stacks/catalog/auth0/app.yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      auth0/app:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          name: "auth0-app"

          # We can centralize plat-sandbox, plat-dev, and plat-staging all use a "nonprod" Auth0 tenant, which is deployed in plat-staging.
          auth0_tenant_stage_name: "plat-staging"

          # Common client configuration
          grant_types:
            - "authorization_code"
            - "refresh_token"
            - "implicit"
            - "client_credentials"

          # Stage-specific client configuration
          callbacks:
            - "https://auth.acme-dev.com/login/auth0/callback"
          allowed_origins:
            - "https://*.acme-dev.com"
          web_origins:
            - "https://portal.acme-dev.com"
            - "https://auth.acme-dev.com"
  ```
